				<h2>What is a dissociative disorder?</h2>
				<p>A dissociative disorder is a mental condition that affects an individuals connection with things like their memory, emotions and sense of self. The individual typically experiences unwanted escapes from reality, resulting in problems with them managing their everyday life.</p>
				<p>There are 3 main types of dissociative disorders;</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Dissociative identity disorder: the individual has two or more separate identities or ‘alters’, with their own traits and histories, that can control the individual’s behaviour at varying times.</li>
					<li>
						Dissociative amnesia: the individual experiences the memory loss of important points of their lives.
					</li>
					<li>
						Depersonalisation/derealisation disorder: Depersonalisation is where the individual feels detached from their thoughts, feelings and their body. Derealisation is where the individual feels disconnected from their environment.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These usually develop as a response to trauma, the individual mentally escaping from what’s happened to them. Dissociative disorders are treatable typically with psychotherapy (talk therapy), although not all cases require treatment as some can resolve on its own.
